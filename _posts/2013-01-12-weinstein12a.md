title: Rollout-based Game-tree Search Outprunes Traditional Alpha-beta
abstract: Recently, rollout-based planning and search methods have emerged as an alternative
  to traditional tree-search methods. The fundamental operation in rollout-based tree
  search is the generation of trajectories in the search tree from root to leaf. Game-playing
  programs based on Monte-Carlo rollouts methods such as “UCT” have proven remarkably
  effective at using information from trajectories to make state-of-the-art decisions
  at the root. In this paper, we show that trajectories can be used to prune more
  aggressively than classical alpha-beta search. We modify a rollout-based method,
  FSSS, to allow for use in game-tree search and show it outprunes alpha-beta both
  empirically and formally.
