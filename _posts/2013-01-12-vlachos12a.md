title: An investigation of imitation learning algorithms for structured prediction
abstract: In the imitation learning paradigm algorithms learn from expert demonstrations
  in order to become able to accomplish a particular task. DaumÃ© III et al. [2009]
  framed structured prediction in this paradigm and developed the search-based structured
  prediction algorithm (Searn) which has been applied successfully to various natural
  language processing tasks with state-of-the-art performance. Recently, Ross et al.
  [2011] proposed the dataset aggre- gation algorithm (DAgger) and compared it with
  Searn in sequential prediction tasks. In this paper, we compare these two algorithms
  in the context of a more complex structured prediction task, namely biomedical event
  extraction. We demonstrate that DAgger has more stable performance and faster learning
  than Searn, and that these advantages are more pronounced in the parameter-free
  versions of the algorithms.
