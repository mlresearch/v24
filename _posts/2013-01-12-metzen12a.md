title: Online Skill Discovery using Graph-based Clustering
abstract: We introduce a new online skill discovery method for reinforcement learning
  in discrete domains. The method is based on the bottleneck principle and identifies
  skills using a bottom-up hierarchical clustering of the estimated transition graph.
  In contrast to prior clustering approaches, it can be used incrementally and thus
  several times during the learning process. Our empirical evaluation shows that ``assuming
  dense local connectivity in the face of uncertainty'' can prevent premature identification
  of skills. Furthermore, we show that the choice of the linkage criterion is crucial
  for dealing with non-random sampling policies and stochastic environments.
