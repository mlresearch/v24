title: Evaluation and Analysis of the Performance of the EXP3 Algorithm in Stochastic
  Environments
abstract: EXP3 is a popular algorithm for adversarial multiarmed bandits, suggested
  and analyzed in this setting by Auer et al. [2002b]. Recently there was an increased
  interest in the performance of this algorithm in the stochastic setting, due to
  its new applications to stochastic multiarmed bandits with side information [Seldin
  et al., 2011] and to multiarmed bandits in the mixed stochastic-adversarial setting
  [Bubeck and Slivkins, 2012]. We present an empirical evaluation and improved analysis
  of the performance of the EXP3 algorithm in the stochastic setting, as well as a
  modification of the EXP3 algorithm capable of achieving “logarithmic” regret in
  stochastic environments.
