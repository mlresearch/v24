title: Feature Reinforcement Learning using Looping Suffix Trees
abstract: There has recently been much interest in history-based methods using suffix
  trees to solve POMDPs. However, these suffix trees cannot efficiently represent
  environments that have long-term dependencies. We extend the recently introduced
  CTÎ¦MDP algorithm to the space of looping suffix trees which have previously only
  been used in solving deterministic POMDPs. The resulting algorithm replicates results
  from CTÎ¦MDP for environments with short term dependencies, while it outperforms
  LSTM-based methods on TMaze, a deep memory environment.
